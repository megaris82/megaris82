# Hi there 👋

I'm a student passionate about technology, with skills in **Java**, **C**, and **Front-End Development**.  
When I'm not coding, I'm most likely gaming 🎮, mainly playing real-time strategy games that revolve around  
quick, analytical thinking and teamwork, skills that nicely transfer over to coding and the job sector!

## Fun Facts
