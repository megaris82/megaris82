# Hi there 👋

I'm a student passionate about technology, with skills in **Java**, **C**, and **Front-End Development**.  
When I'm not coding, I'm most likely gaming 🎮 — mainly playing real-time strategy games that revolve around  
quick, analytical thinking and teamwork — skills that nicely transfer over to coding and the job sector!

## Fun Facts
- Participated in two Erasmus volunteering short exchanges in France and Germany 🌍  
  Strengthening my social and teamwork skills while learning about hot social topics!
